# WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW BEFORE EXECUTING THIS SCRIPT, 'get_project_data.R'
################################################################################

# DESCRIPTION: This script downloads and extracts the 'UCI HAR Dataset'
#              in the working directory if the folder doesn't exists.

# DOWNLOAD URL:
# "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip"

# PLAN:        Checks if the data files are available.
#              If the data don't exist,
#                  1. downloads the zipped file
#                  2. creates a log file,
#                     with the url used and the date of the download
#                  3. extracts the zipped file
#              else if the data files exist,
#                  1. informs that the files already exist

# NOTES:       When 'get_project_data.R' is executed,
#              informative messages are printed in console,
#              to describe what the script tries to do.

      ## it will mistakenly assume that it contains the correct data files.
